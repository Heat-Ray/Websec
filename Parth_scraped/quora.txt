But Here I would like to share my experience with the best college which is good for the students. where students get quality education as well as the placements.Talking about the Lovely Professional University- LPU [1] let me tell you about it from my experience and from the feedback of many friends and juniors who took admission in LPU from my reference.If you are looking for industry oriented academics, practical based curriculum, professional corporate culture during the college life itself, and better placement in any fortune company, then Lovely Professional University- LPU is totally worth it.Let me clear you why. Generally, the basic factors you see in any university or institute while choosing it for your future are your desired branch with good infrastructure, placements, academics, faculties and support.Comparison helps when you are confused between the two options. If you have any other options apart from LPU, which forced you to ask this worthy question, then better visit all the options and compare the basic common needs.Honestly, I was confused too before coming here in LPU. For solving this confusion, I looked for the best key points that define the institute as the best education body. I have brief knowledge about LPU, so I can help you with that.1. Infrastructure: The University is spread over 600 acres which provide each and every facility to their students inside the campus. Well, considering education, well-equipped labs are designed with the experienced faculty and the lab assistants that make you excel in the study.The faculty members are the student-friendly that you won't regret study in the university. But let me buzz you that we have more than 13,000 CCTV installed in the campus so be careful on your moves.2. College and University Faculty: Every semester, the syllabus is updated. The faculty members are available all the time of the week so that the student can approach any time of the week. We have lots of experienced faculty members specialized in the certain fields that can help you boost the knowledge, help build up your projects, guide you in your pace of life, any personal or educational issues, etc.4. Diversity: The University with the most diverse student population. Students from all across the world live in the hostel, which comes closest to being 'a home away from home'. The mixture of races and religions helps to build a decent environment. It’s very exciting because you’ll get a chance to interact with people from different nationalities, cultures and different backgrounds. Being a part of this university is always what I had hoped for from the time my neighbour shared with me his college life experience at LPU.5. Campus Life: At the end of a tiring day or week, everyone expects entertainment and refreshing ways to uplift their daily boring schedule. But here in LPU, they conduct so many big events where they call popular celebrities and help their students to feel more alive and energetic, which make the life in LPU more of fun.6. Campus Placements: LPU has excelled in the placement records as students are trained with the professional enhancement program classes, where they teach and educate you about the interview skills and etiquettes. Moreover, the university has been ranked high by outer agencies also with regard to placements of our students.Well let me tell you about recent trends of placements in LPU. As if at the end of your degree, you got a dream package in any fortune company, then according to me everything is worth it.Lovely Professional University- LPU being the Largest Private University in India having 30000+ students studying in more than 200+ courses, which includes 6000+ International Students from 70+ Countries of the World , LPU has lived up to its expectations, with the quality of education satisfying these international students, the placement opportunities are amazing as well.AA+ Infrastructure including shopping malls, refreshment centers, Largest Private University Accommodation in the world, 13000 + CC cameras, indoor transportation system, University Management System , etcWith Quality of Education, Placements in LPU is also amazing, with the top brand in the world coming for Campus Recruitment provides great opportunities to its students.Some of the Placement opportunities in LPU :More than 550 students hired on a single day by Cognizant, not once but TWICE that is more than 1000 students, which has set a record in the whole of North India.2019, 3 Engineering students offered 28 LPA from Amazon (company) for their AI SKILLS.LPU’s Business School’s Bachelors students recruited for Royal Bank of Scotland .MBA Students are getting placed at an average package of >4–6 LPA in more than 100 companies. More than 150+ companies have already visited 2017–2017 MBA batch of MBA and nearly all of them are already placed and many of them already on OJT(on the job training)These are some of the companies which come for placements at a very good package for all courses.Hyatt Regency Miami USA and Great Wolf Lodge Wisconsin selected 6 students at the package of 15 Lakh Per Annum.Hotel Management students are getting placed in the above companies, which LPU has collaboration and tie-ups with.Agricultural Students are recruited in some of the most well-known companies as above.The talented individual always has the opportunity of getting a gold medal, it is very much possible and what about getting your degree on your convocation from personalities like The President of India, The Vice President of India, His Holiness The Dalai Lama, The President of Mauritius, etc, the list will go on.Overall LPU provides placement opportunities to all the deserving candidates, from all courses. It is up to the student's capability to be able to grab the opportunity or not. Till now thousand of students are placed at a very good package all around the world. Some of the Alumni are working in the top 10 brands in the world. I said alumni, that includes me, and working in top brands with a heavy package, even after doing masters or giving any other exam, makes the graduation from Lpu, totally worth it.Now I hope this much content is enough for you to make a decision, and yeah stop depending on others statements, and go and see the reality on the ground. Visit the campus, check the labs, infrastructure, faculty, and everything which you wants and then decide. It will help you better.Happy learningFootnotes[1] India's Largest Best Private University in Punjab343 views · View 3 Upvoters · Answer requested by  Kanhaiya Soni  Kunal Chalotra, M.tech Information Security, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal (2019)Answered Mar 13, 2019 · Author has 54 answers and 41.3k answer viewsOriginally Answered: Which are the top universities in India?The first ever edition of the QS India University Rankings, released today, sees 75 Indian universities rank among the best in the nation, based on a methodology which assesses each institution’s academic and employer reputations, as well as research impact, percentage of international students and faculty members and other factors.

Around 3 lakhs students are appearing for VITEEE every year. And check the NIRF ranking of VIT University conducted by MHRD. Being a private institution there must be few cons associated but you can easily neglect those and continue your studies. They have so many foreign tie ups and you will find so many foreigners studying at VIT as well.For admission in VIT you must have to appear in VITEEE 2019 and get a rank under 1 lakh to be eligible for counselling for admissions at Vellore, Chennai and Amravati Campuses and 1.5 lakh for Bhopal Campus.VIT University has been a consistent topper for several years in the list of campus placement records among private institutions in India. It is proud that its graduates are highly rated by employers from industry and commerce in the private and public sectors.Check the NIRF ranking of VIT University in 2018. Offering information, advice, guidance and support for job-seeking students is considered a primary responsibility at the University.VITEEE is comparatively less tougher examination than JEE Mains and BITSAT.VITEEE is harder than SRMJEEE and in reputation also VIT is much better than SRM.By sheer hard work and passion along with proper time management during the exam can get you a very good rank in VITEEE 2019.For Computer Science Engineering at Vellore campus you need to have a rank around 5k so that you can get this branch in 1st category at Vellore Campus.For getting admission in VIT Vellore,Chennai and Amravati you need to have a rank under 1 lakh and for Bhopal campus it is under 1.5 lakh. Now again getting a rank under 1 lakh doesn't mean that you will get admission in any desired stream or any specific campus. It's just a rank to be eligible to attend the counselling and somehow compromise with the available branch at your rank during the counselling.Target for atleast 100+ correct questions (Out of 125)to secure your chances of getting a handsome rank.VITEEE 2019 is an online test and will be held on multiple dates(Slots) at various centres throughout India. If you are targeting just VIT then I would advise you to target few more entrances as well viz. BITSAT, MU-OET etc to be on a safer side.Concentrate more on JEE-Mains 2019 and BITSAT 2019.If you study NCERT then VITEEE 2019 will be very easy for you to tackle and apart from that practice mocks from Arihant publication and Dishapublication will be an added advantage. You can practice past 10 years sample paper of VITEEE as well to understand the pattern of the questions.VITEEE ranks are highly unpredictable since they use relative grading based on percentile and not the exact score actually scored by you. VIT is a great place to join for undergraduate engineering degree.Aim for top IITs ,NITs, IIITs, COEP, DTU ,NSIT and top govt institution before VIT Vellore.So study hard and make your parents proudHope It Helps.Thanks226 views  Priya Sharma, Senior Counselor at AfterGraduation (2017-present)Answered Feb 8, 2018 · Author has 161 answers and 217.6k answer viewsIn the latest , Times Asian Universities Ranking 2018 - IISc Bangalore and IIT Bombay were two Indian Universities in top 50.India’s representation in the Times Higher Education (THE) annual Asian Universities ranking has improved to 42 from last year’s 33 but the ranking of several registered Universities have declined, and only two Indian institutes- IISc Bangalore and IIT Bombay have made their way to the top 50 Asian Universities.ISM Dhanbad, Banaras Hindu University, Jamia Millia Islamia and 9 other Indian institutions have for the first time made it to the list of top-350 varsities in the Asian Universities Ranking 2018.
