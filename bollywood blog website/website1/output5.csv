"Rani dropped by a birthday party on Monday wearing her floral print pants again, this time with a cutout sleeve top and ,Dior ,pumps. You’ll remember seeing her wear the pants with a lace top and ,Dolce & Gabbana, pumps ,last year,.,We sure like seeing stars wear pieces from their wardrobe again and again.,

I don’t mind a belt on a sari but only when it is needed, like when you are wearing a long top and have to define the waist. In her case, considering the short blouse, I don’t think it was needed.,Having said that though, I still thought she looked nice here.,

Jewelry from ,House of Shikha, and sandals from ,Eridani, were among her accessories for the occasion. She wears her look well but the sari itself, we aren’t the biggest champions of. Ruffle-trimmed saris sometimes work, this unfortunately didn’t, especially when paired with the blouse.,
