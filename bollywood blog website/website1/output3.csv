As for the separates one, she should’ve skipped the belt altogether there.,

I may not like the scarf sleeve design but overall, I like that she showed restrain here. This was a relatively simple outing on her part. And I say that because right after this event she dialed it up in a look from ,Dice Kayek,. Way way up. See inside.,

,  ,(more…),Wearing a ,Ziad Germanos, leather gown, Kareena filmed an eoisode of her television show recently. Tousled hair and ,Truffle Collection, sandals rounded out the actor’s look.,The gown works for the ott world of reality television. Off the set though, not a fan of it; the green sash didn’t quite look like it belonged on the dress. My feelings about the dress aside, can’t fault Kareena’s appearance; she made every bit of that dress work for her. And the hair and make-up was on point too!,
