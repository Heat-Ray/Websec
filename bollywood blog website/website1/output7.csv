Considering she had just worn a Dolce & Gabbana dress, also with ankle-strap sandals, I was surprised to see another floral look so quickly but then realized, this was a different movie that she was promoting and with it also was a different stylist.,Either ways, which of the two yellow floral looks did you like more?,
